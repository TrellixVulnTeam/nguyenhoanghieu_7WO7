					Art, the most unfamiliar subject in Vietnam, from literature to music, to
					painting.
					Since very few proportion of Vietnamese are art pursuer, whoever talented in art
					gains significant attention from the public.
					This happens to be true,especially during the Vietnam war and during the 1980 -
					1990. Those times become springs for art, during which art blossomed.
					However, move forward to 21th century, genZ witnesses the boom in art
					industries, especially music. But then, since it becomes so common, its values
					are fading. Until it reaches a point, where art is just the static name: a
					product of which the people are the consumers. <br><br>

					Art was never part of my memories, not a single role in my life.
					Maybe like chill but that is it.
					That explain why most of the books I read as a kid is because my mom forced me
					to.
					I was never into books or painting or any of such things.
					For me, it was just a errand or a habit that any parents thinks that it is good
					and try to force their kids to do.
					But still, art and I never in a fight or hatred, only a slight annoyance; still,
					I was a good kid so I still follow along my mom to do those art even though it
					makes no impact on me.
					But then schooltime came, art formed into a subject I hated, for its meaningless
					application and purpose.
					Moreover, I was never expected myself to pursue in art -so do all of my friends
					and literally everyone around me;
					I hated it for its confusing details;
					I hated it because thanks to it, I got low grades which I believe I do not
					deserve.
					I hated it for it paradoxical for when a “your”-opinions question comes up and I
					wrote them down, the teacher grades it and even criticize it;
					Really?! It is as if the teacher misprint the word “your” for “the teacher’s”.
					Before I know, art is out of my sight. Gone. <br><br>

					But then, years pass by, I am in high school now.
					Still in school yet I am in a worse situation: I have to fight my illness with a
					strict treatment - the treatment, which put me in struggles. Like a lost fish, I
					was drown in the real world and in my own world as well.
					Trap in solitude, I become my worst enemies, my worst fear.
					People always say they love themself. But trust me, when you are alone, facing
					directly with yourself, all the problems of your will lie in front of you like
					when opening an old box seeing a tons of mouses and you will be so frighten.
					All the dismay, the self-rotten thoughts and feelings will hunt for you, making
					you sleepless, your mind will ever rest, it will think and think, regret and
					regret, upset and upset, haunt you till you fall asleep and come back right when
					you wake up.
					It was exhausting, days after days.

					Alone in my world, I need something to heal me.
					So I look up. I first try to walk, walking around the block or maybe around a
					lake, contemplating the surroundings.
					Then comes the talking. As the thoughts rush to my mind while I walking, I
					response.
					A conversation where the listener is the one talking. Then naturally, I come to
					books and writing.
					For me, they serve as a walk: a way to scruntinize and reflecting myself.
					Then we start to be friends: art and I. For now, in my mind, art becomes a
					different person, through which I learn about myself and the world.
					A song from Trinh Cong Son, a famous musicist in Vietnam, about his own fear of
					death: Cat Bui (Dust) mark my new realization for art.
					A song about death, I mean, sounds pretty dreadful. But then listening to it, it
					is not death that I see but a man who try to fight his feelings, the same way as
					I do: pouring himself in art. From thoughts to feelings to emotions.
					Now art shows me the inner of myself. The more understand myself, the more calm
					and stable I become. But that does not mean I become a rock. NO. I become me
					without the fear of my strange self, the confusion of my emotions, my feelings,
					my thoughts, of what I want and who I am.
					Then slowly and steady, listening to music, reading book, writing become not
					only my habit but my food, the food that heal and enrich the mind, heart and
					soul. <br><br>

					We, as Gen Z, are becoming lonelier than ever according to science.
					But heck, why don’t we take it as chance to take get yourself out of this
					fast-pace world and spend some quality times enjoying, reflecting ourself.
					And art might be the way for us, learning to enjoy is like learning to enjoy a
					cup of tea: slowly, but impactful.
					Only then do we get a better understanding of ourself so that later when we dive
					in the world, we will not be dissolved.

					The nature seems to be so intense these recent days. The sound of the cicada hiding
					behind the leaves is louder and
					louder, taking over the surroundings. The flowers of the vigorous flamboyant
					trees alongside the streets start
					to bloom, just like a vigorous firework with its redness. The sun now, like a
					hardworking person, wakes up
					earlier with its beautiful faint yellow sunshine and works its best a day before
					slowly resting behind the
					buildings. The hotness from the sun also becomes so significant these days:
					around noon, after absorbing all the
					heat, the road turns into a pan and the people moving on it now look like
					shrimps; but then after someday, the
					shrimps will finally earn what they need: rain, heavyweight ones with thunders
					and lightnings. All of these
					could only be one “symptom”: summer. <br><br>

					Yes. Summer. A not cool season for adults but it is the best season of the year
					for the kids. I am no exception.
					Up until 9th grade, summer was always my favorite time of the year. I was able
					to put my mind into the things I
					liked to do without all the worries of school: to go out, to explore, to travel
					and to make friends. Basically,
					I was a butterfly and summer is my time to break out of the cocoon. Whenever I
					think of the past, summertime is
					always the main part; I even believe that I learned more in just 3 months of
					summer than in 9 months of schools.
					<br><br>

					But then, high school comes, carrying my hopes and expectations for it to be the
					best three years of my life,
					especially during summers. But here I am living in the moment, in the last
					summer of my high school, feeling
					completely lost.

					You can feel lonely and surrounded at the same time. With the rise of social
					media, you have a society within just a small device; you are surrounded, are
					heard, are seen.
					Social media basically defines your definition of existence. However, with so
					many voice, social media is too crowded for one’s voice to be significant.
					Social media is just a temporary healing since later it could be a poison to your
					“I”. You can text your friends and have a fun time with them, but then all of
					a sudden, just when you guys stop chatting, you feel empty, lonely and
					somewhat frustration.
					You could cry; you could feel guilty for whatever you done; you could feel
					clueless about the the world; Worst, you could feel that the road ahead of you
					is a dead end.
					<br><br>No longer ignorants, we are acknowledging the world better than ever,
					our abilities are unlimited, but since we are so young, our understanding of
					ourself is vague,at least that is what I feel, which may explain for the 
					insecurity and inconfidence. Therefore, as teenage, we should be able to defined
					ourself on our own. But to do such thing is no easy. For some, the chance to
					find out their “I” could be like a piece of cake. However, for most, it is not.
					For me, the knot is even tighter, trust me when I say it is much tight than normal.
					What surprise me even more is the things that hinder, challenge me the most: my
					self and my emotions. This blog is not only to record my journey, both its up
          and down side, but also myself and my emotions.<br><br>
